Now let's have deep dive into command line app 

## How to run Currency-Converter

 1. **Clone** this Github repository 
 2. **Install** all dependencies specified in requirements. txt
 3. Run **main.py**

main.py will demand 3 arguments from user
1. Source currency code
2. Target currency code
3. Amount to convert

The command line program will not only Display the converted amount, but will also inform the user of what the conversion value would have been if the previous/last month's or year's exchange rate had been used.

See the demo below:-
Say i want to convert USD 5 to INR

run main.py

    code>main.py
    ******************************
    Welcome to Currency convertor

The last two lines describe the conversion using historical data from the prior month and year.

Currency code can be found from [here](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes)

## How it works?

we have three files 

 1. exchange_rate.py
 2. history.py
 3. main.py

 **main. py** :-
 
This is the script that calls the necessary functions from other files in the same directory and displays Conversion to the user.

**exchange_rate.py** :-

This file has a function named get exchange rate, which returns the exchange rate. The function is called by the main script, and the exchange rate obtained is multiplied by the amount given by the user, and the result is presented to the user.

The get_exchange_rate method uses the API to retrieve the current exchange rate.

**history. py**:-

This file provides functions for retrieving the prior month and year dates, which are then passed to the get_exchange_rate function in exchange rate.py to obtain the exchange rate at that time.

Once we have an exchange rate, the converted value is shown to the user in the last two lines.
