*Q. Why i called it real time ?*

*--> Because, currency exchange rate's are dynamic and get constatntly fluctuate due to the fact that a currency's value is determined by a variety of factors in the country

Now let's have deep dive into command line app 

## How to run Currency-Converter

 1. **Clone** this Github repository 
 2. **Install** all dependencies specified in requirements. txt
 3. Run **main.py**

main.py will demand 3 arguments from user
1. Source currency code
2. Target currency code
3. Amount to convert

The command line program will not only Display the converted amount, but will also inform the user of what the conversion value would have been if the previous/last month's or year's exchange rate had been used.

See the demo below:-
Say i want to convert USD 5 to INR

run main.py

    code>main.py
    ******************************
    Welcome to Currency convertor
    ******************************
    
    Please type 3 letter country code
    Convert from USD
    Convert to INR
    Amount to convert USD 5
    ******************************
    USD 5 equals to INR 376.990445
    
    last month USD 5 was equals to INR 381.867520
    last year USD 5 was equals to INR 366.398745

The last two lines describe the conversion using historical data from the prior month and year.

Currency code can be found from [here](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes)

## How it works?

we have three files 

 1. exchange_rate.py
 2. history.py
 3. main.py

 **main. py** :-
 
This is the script that calls the necessary functions from other files in the same directory and displays Conversion to the user.

**exchange_rate.py** :-

This file has a function named get exchange rate, which returns the exchange rate. The function is called by the main script, and the exchange rate obtained is multiplied by the amount given by the user, and the result is presented to the user.

The get_exchange_rate method uses the API to retrieve the current exchange rate.

**history. py**:-

This file provides functions for retrieving the prior month and year dates, which are then passed to the get_exchange_rate function in exchange rate.py to obtain the exchange rate at that time.

Once we have an exchange rate, the converted value is shown to the user in the last two lines.

## Future Goal : 

 - To Provide currency conversion without the use of an API!

## üë® A little bit about me

This is [Mayank Chaudhari](https://mayankvision.wordpress.com/), a person who has been fascinated by technology from childhood and who enjoys  digging into technologies that have potential to make change in the society . 

I am very excited about **Full stack development** and **computer vision** field as i believe world is coming online and *AI revolution* is about to heat the world! and i want to be the part of this new revolution


## üìù My other work 


Let me showcase some of my work in the context of computer vision.

 - Face mask detector
 - Sharpener detector
 - Biscuit detector

All the models i made have some real life application in industry 

My models stand's out since I did not utilise a large amount of data to train them. For the biscuit detector, I used 20 images, and for the face mask, I did not use any real images.

My biscuit detector stands out because it recognises excellent biscuits on the conveyor belt and intelligently discards defective ones; for more information, [click here](https://mayankvision.wordpress.com)!

In consideration with development, let me highlight some of my work
